1. If you have a new ATmega328P , youâ€™ll need to burn the bootloader onto the chip first.
Please follow our instructions in the following tutorial:
https://www.circuito.io/blog/atmega328p-bootloader/                                      

2. After uploading the sketches onto the ATMega328P, open the serial monitor and reboot the ATMega328P to view the test code menu.
